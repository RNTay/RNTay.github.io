            <h2> Current Work </h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a third year BSc Mathematics student at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Warwick</a>. My third year modules are centred around analysis and set theory. <br>
                <br>
                I am currently (as of June 2024) involved in the following activities:
                <ul>
                    <li> Creating an expository piece which introduces the theory of optimal transport. Supervised by <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/evans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Josephine Evans</a>. </li>
                    <li> Working on open Tur&aacute;n problems in extremal combinatorics. Supervised by <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/oleg_pikhurko" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Professor Oleg Pikhurko</a>, 
                        and collaborating with (among several others) my fellow undergraduates Musab Guma'a, Tom King, Kit Liu, Matthew Phillips, and Kyle Thompson. </li>
                    <li> As part of an online reading group on Discord, reading through the first few chapters of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60231-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Combinatorial Set Theory</i></a> by Lorenz Halbeisen. </li>
                    <li> Learning <i>&Eacute;tude No. 1</i> by Heitor Villa-Lobos.</li>
                </ul>
