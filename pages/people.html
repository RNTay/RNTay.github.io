            In life, people come and people go. For just a brief moment, let us let the sentiments (and cringe) take over.

            It would not be feasible to have a comprehensive list of everyone who has significantly impacted my life, nor would it be appropriate to list my many close friends and family members.
            For the sake of keeping this somewhat professional, this page is a list, in backwards chronological order of the first time I met them, of people who played an influential role in my life from a personal and professional point of view.

            Dr Adam Epstein was the first person to expose me to the world of logic. Chiefly, he was the main supervisor for me in my MA395 Essay module as well as the lecturer for the MA3L1 Topics in Set Theory module.
            During our many chats (in-person, over email, and on Microsoft Teams) spreading over a wide range of topics from set theory to logic to category theory to topology to analysis to general mathematics pedagogy, I learned a wealth of material from him.
            Through our chats and his lectures for the module MA3L1 Topics in Set Theory, I got to practise and appreciate mathematical pedantry. The endless exercises he provided, through his exercise sheets (or even in the middle of a conversation!), built my mathematical resilience as well as appreciation for many minute details.
            He is a thorough joy to converse with, and his careful guidance in my third year ensured I had enough background knowledge to pursue logic at a postgraduate level.

            Dr David Wood, my personal tutor throughout my BSc Mathematics degree at the University of Warwick, and also the one who lectured the module MA133 Differential Equations in my first undergraduate year.
            I have never once not looked forward to his (bi)weekly tutorial meetings with the rest of my tutor group: Alan Thanickal, Eddie Taylor, Rizwan Tariq, and Sean Thewlis.
            Sometimes maths would happen in these meetings, but we mainly used them to keep him in the loop on how we were all doing and have a fun chat.
            He portrayed a proper mix of fun and seriousness in his lectures and tutorial meetings, and that was the attitude to which I approached my undergraduate degree. A loveable guy, generally.
            Some of the most common chats involved administrative issues, and it is these chats that taught me how much good admin hides the chaos from the users.
            The number of frustrations I have with whatever system I am currently working in dramatically decreased when, through these chats, I realised how difficult it can be to create a system which accommodate everyone.
            Seemingly silly problems with simple fixes from my (and many students') point of view(s) turned out to already have been hotly debated and fought with by both him and the administrative team.

            Dr Hina Khan was my IGCSE Biology teacher. She is perhaps my favourite teacher from my schooling years; her passion for teaching and helping immature children, as I once was, was clear from day 1.
            Biology was one of several subjects I struggled with in my schooling years. It was to her that I made my first confession in my educational life of not being able to keep up, after I received a substandard grade for a mock test.
            Pretty soon after that, she set up an after-school biology club, which entailed her going through the contents of IGCSE Biology with me (and a couple other schoolmates) again at a slower pace.
            All of these sessions involved an active participation from my (and my peers') part(s). The discussions kept the sessions engaging and entertaining for young me, and helped me learn the material quicker.
            The nature of these sessions encouraging conversations sometimes meant we diverged into informal chats. It is from these chats that I started to change the way I think and the way I approached life and friendships.
            Clich&eacute; as it may sound, she was that one teacher I who shaped me to be who I am today.
