            <h3>What's the best way to contact you?</h3>
            <p>
            You can contact me by sending an email to any of the following email addresses:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> rntay {(a)} yahoo.com </li>
                    <li> ryan.tay {(a)} mail.com </li>
		    <li> rnt27 {(a)} cam.ac.uk </li>
                </ul>
		        Note that the domain of one of my personal emails is @mail.com, and <i>not</i> @gmail.com. <br>
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Identify yourself.</h3>
            <p>
                My preferred pronouns are he/him/his.
            </p>

            <h3>Why "rntay"?</h3>
            <p>
            	My middle name starts with the letter N. A non-insignificant number of friends have said that they thought that "rn" is some shortening of the name "Ryan".
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>I found a mathematical mistake in one of your writings.</h3>
            <p>
                Please do tell me about it. I fix mistakes as soon as I become aware of them (and how to fix them). 
                A lot of my writing is done in the middle of the night; I would read them with great caution.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>I found a grammatical mistake in one of your writings.</h3>
            <p>
                Keep it to yourself.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Can you hurry up with [piece of writing]?</h3>
            <p>
                If you are not my current supervisor, ask yourself this: in a world where George R. R. Martin has not finished <i>The Winds of Winter</i>, is my writing pace really that slow? <br>
		
		If you <i>are</i> my current supervisor, I promise you it's taking up every nearly every waking moment for me.

                What's your favourite cereal?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cornflakes.
            </p>

                What's your favourite joke?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A Spanish magician told everyone he could disappear into thin air. He said "Uno, dos, ...", and then disappeared without a tres.

            <h3>
                What are your political beliefs?
            </h3>
            <p>
		I have plenty of opinions, some of which I'm willing to defend over a drink (does not have to be alcoholic).
		<li> 0 is a natural number. </li>
		<li> The most important category is the category <b>Set</b> of sets and functions. </li>
		<li> The letter "Z" should be pronounced as "Zee" so that the alphabet song rhymes. </li>
		<li> Em dashes should have spaces around them; en dashes and hyphens should not. </li>
		<li> Thin crispy fries are better than thick chonky fries. </li>
		<li> Cyclists should obey the traffic laws like cars. This isn't an opinion. It's the law. Do better, cyclists. </li>
