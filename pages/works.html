		<h2>Personal Expository Works </h2>
            These works are mainly exercises in self-learning or notes I have written to explain a certain concept to someone else (typically a friend). They are a lot more personal and do not reflect the teaching standards of any institution/organisation.

                    Does there exist a non-empty complete dense unbounded linear order in which every collection of pairwise disjoint open intervals is at most countable? 
                    Certainly. The real line is one such linear order. Are there any others? This was a question which was asked by Mikhail Suslin in 1919.
                    It took till 1971 to show that ZFC can neither prove nor disprove the existence of any such linear orders other than the real line, unless ZFC is inconsistent.
                    We build up to this independence result by Robert Solovay and Stanley Tennenbaum, using the technique of forcing.

                    A set of notes introducing G&ouml;del's constructible universe as well as forcing. We establish the independence of the continuum hypothesis and show that ZFC has very little control over the size of the real line.

                    Why is the axiom of choice so controversial? In this document I lay out all the reasons why I believe that one should avoid the use of the axiom of choice.

                    This document contains a proof of Zorn's lemma without the use of ordinals, making for a more elementary proof of Zorn's lemma from the axiom of choice.

                    This is an exploration of several properties of the Wasserstein 1-distance, which is a way of measuring distances between probability measures.
                    We limit our attention to probability measures on the real line to simplify notations as well as obtaining further properties, though a lot of the results can be generalised.

                    This is an introduction to several cardinal characteristics of the continuum. In particular, we discuss the cardinals which appear in Cicho&nacute;'s diagram and the rearrangement number, which stemmed from a MathOverflow post.
                    This essay is mainly about proving several inequalities between these cardinals in ZFC.
