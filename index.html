                This page is intended to give a bare-bones view of what I have done during my time on this planet. If you're here, you're likely particularly interested in my work. 
                Currently, this consists of expository materials on a range of topics in mathematics. You can find all of them here:

                <br> <br>
                You may have questions for me, such as "How do I contact you?", or "What are you doing these days?", or "Why does the style of your homepage look like it ought to start off with 'In memorium...'?" 
                Two of these questions are answered in the link below, the third will be answered in due time, and you can send any other questions my way.

                Pardon me, I haven't even introduced myself! Hello there! I'm Ryan. 
                How does one even write a biography? From the very beginning, as Maria von Trapp would say? On the other hand, Kevin Malone thinks that's a waste of time, since "few word do trick".
